- High connexion/sec & RAM & latency performances, built around Swoole framework instead of traditional LAMP.

- TODO : isomorphic twig views, no more page refresh with local cache system and updater

- TODO : webpack hmr support

- TODO : optional isomorphic rust components (thanks to php-ext-wasm)

- TODO : No model, ORM or shit, instead we use plain PostgreSQL and its function (stored procedures) system.

- TODO : Bundle system, share assets and controllers between your projects. Just reuse what you did / you want in your other projects.
Write easily your own common tools & management area for all your projects.
